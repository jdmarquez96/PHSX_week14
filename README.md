#The clusters are very close to the true mixture values, and I believe 
#it does depend on the amount of data because though I generated the plots
#and one can tell where the points come from, the clustering caused
#for some of the values from one gaussian to be counted as coming from a 
#from a different cluster, causign for the cluster values to be 
#underesitmated

#I don't the model changes much other than adding a new cluster; it still
#is able to get close to the true values.
